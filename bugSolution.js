The root cause of the intermittent crash is difficult to pin down without more consistent error messages. However, this solution addresses potential scenarios. Note that this is a general approach, and the actual solution would depend on your application's specific structure and module usage:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import * as React from 'react';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const checkModule = async () => {
      try {
        // Attempt to access the potentially problematic native module
        // Replace 'problematicModule' with the name of the suspected module.
        const module = await require('problematicModule');
        // Use module here if available
        console.log('Native module loaded successfully');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Native module not found or error loading:', error);
        // Implement fallback or alternative functionality. This prevents the app from crashing.
        // For example, display a message to the user indicating the feature is unavailable.
        alert('Feature temporarily unavailable due to an error.');
      }
    };
    checkModule();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
This approach uses a `try...catch` block to handle the potential `require` error gracefully.  It also includes a fallback mechanism (an alert in this case) so the app doesn't crash, instead displaying an informative message to the user.  Additional debugging steps such as checking the Expo Go console logs and device logs would be essential in pinpointing the exact module causing the issue.
